evitaDB helps developers to create fast product catalog applications, which are the heart of every e-commerce site.
Catalogs work with hierarchical structures, facet search, price search, range search, localisation and fulltext.
All these requirements could be solved by general-purpose databases - either relational like [PosgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/),
[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), no-sql like [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
But in reality, these tasks are quite complex for all these databases and require a lot of work on the part of 
the application developer. The e-commerce problems can be solved in many ways in these databases, but initial and
often naive implementations happen to be very under-performing when the dataset grows larger, or quickly become hard
to maintain and evolve further.

The developers of evitaDB have been implementing e-commerce stores on various database platforms for several years. We
have experience with multi-page SQL queries, lock wait timeouts, data de-normalisation and other side-effects of 
traditional relational solutions. We have also tasted the dark side of distributed non-SQL databases
which also required multi-page queries and revealed problems with (lack of) transactionality, eventual consistency
and hard-to-understand schema definition and querying. We have always felt that we trade a lot of simplicity for the sake of
acceptable latency, and we aim for a system that is both simple and performant for the majority of e-commerce
use cases. The plug and play device that just works.

That's why we applied for [an EU research grant](https://evitadb.io/project-info), which allowed us to dedicate necessary
time trying to create an alternative to general-purpose databases, that would meet our needs. The [progress
and results of our research](https://evitadb.io/research/introduction) happening between 2019 and 2022 are documented 
in the separate part of this site.

      <dd>
         A catalog isolates one data-set from another. In relational database world a catalog would represent a single 
         database schema. It represents a physical container for set of logically interconnected entity collections.
         evitaDB usually contains multiple catalogs. If you need to take care of data for multiple customers 
         (multi-tenant application) it's a good idea to dedicate separate catalog to each of them.

      <dt>entity collection</dt>
      <dd>
         An entity collection encompass all entities sharing the same schema (structure). In relational database world
         an entity collection would represent a one or tables that contain data of one logical entity. An entity is
         closer to a "document" term used in NoSQL databases or "object" 
         in [OOP terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) than to a "table record".
