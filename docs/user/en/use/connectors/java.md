**Work in progress**

This article will contain description of Java, mainly the ideas behind its design from the API consumer perspective
(not from the perspective of the Java API developer). It should also contain recommendations and hint how to use
API correctly.

The chapter should not describe the API itself - since there is separate [chapter](../api/api.md) about it, but rather
describe the usage from the client point of view.

This chapter should contain description both for embedded and for remote evitaDB server.
