The evitaDB server is configured in YAML format and its default settings are best described by the following code
snippet:

```yaml

##### Where the default configuration bundled with Docker image is located?
</NoteTitle>

The default configuration file is located in the file <SourceClass>docker/evita-configuration.yaml</SourceClass>.
As you can see, it contains variables that allow the propagation of arguments from the command line / environment
variables that are present when the server is started. The format used in this file is :

```
${argument_name:defaultValue}
```
</Note>

## Server configuration

This section contains general settings for the evitaDB server. It allows configuring thread pools, queues, timeouts:

<dl>
    <dt>coreThreadCount</dt>
    <dd>
        **Default:** `4`

        It defines the minimum number of threads in the evitaDB main thread pool, threads are used for query processing, 
        transactional updates and service tasks (vacuuming, cache revalidation). The value should be at least equal to 
        the number of machine cores.
    </dd>
    <dt>maxThreadCount</dt>
    <dd>
        **Default:** `16`

        It defines the maximum number of threads in the evitaDB main thread pool. The value should be a multiple of the 
        `coreThreadCount` value.
    </dd>
    <dt>threadPriority</dt>
    <dd>
        **Default:** `5`

        It defines the priority of the threads created in the pool (for future use). 
    </dd>
    <dt>queueSize</dt>
    <dd>
        **Default:** `100`

        It defines the maximum number of tasks that can accumulate in the queue waiting for the free thread from 
        the thread pool to process them. Tasks that exceed this limit will be discarded (new requests/other tasks will 
        fail with an exception).
    </dd>
    <dt>closeSessionsAfterSecondsOfInactivity</dt>
    <dd>
        **Default: `60`**

        It specifies the maximum acceptable period of 
        <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/EvitaSessionContract.java</SourceClass> inactivity before 
        it is forcibly closed by the server side.
    </dd>
</dl>

## Storage configuration

This section contains configuration options for the storage layer of the database.

<dl>
    <dt>storageDirectory</dt>
    <dd>
        **Default:** `null`

        It defines the folder where evitaDB stores its catalog data. The path can be specified relative to the working
        directory of the application in absolute form (recommended).
    </dd>
    <dt>lockTimeoutSeconds</dt>
    <dd>
        **Default:** `60`

        It specifies the maximum amount of time the thread may wait to get an exclusive WRITE lock on the file to write 
        its data. Changing this value should not be necessary if everything is going well.
    </dd>
    <dt>waitOnCloseSeconds</dt>
    <dd>
        **Default:** `60`

        It specifies a timeout for evitaDB to wait for the release of read handles to a file. If the file handle is not 
        released within the timeout, the calling process will get an exception. Changing this value should not be 
        necessary if everything works fine.
    </dd>
    <dt>outputBufferSize</dt>
    <dd>
        **Default:** `4MB`

        The output buffer size determines how large a buffer is kept in memory for output purposes. The size of the 
        buffer limits the maximum size of an individual record in the key/value data store.
    </dd>
    <dt>maxOpenedReadHandles</dt>
    <dd>
        **Default:** `12`

        It defines the maximum number of simultaneously opened file read handles.

        <Note type="warning">
            This setting should be set in sync with file handle settings in operating system. 
            Read these articles for [Linux](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/limit-file-descriptors) or 
            [MacOS](https://gist.github.com/tombigel/d503800a282fcadbee14b537735d202c)            
        </Note>
    </dd>
    <dt>computeCRC32C</dt>
    <dd>
        **Default:** `true`

        It determines whether CRC32C checksums are calculated for written records in a key/value store, and also whether 
        the CRC32C checksum is checked when a record is read.

        It is strongly recommended that this setting be set to `true`, as it will report potentially corrupt records as 
        early as possible.
    </dd>
</dl>

## Cache configuration

## API configuration

### TLS configuration

TLS support is enabled by default and cannot be disabled. It's configured in the `certificate` subsection of the `api`.
It allows configuring these settings:

<dl>
  <dt>generateAndUseSelfSigned</dt>
  <dd>
    **Default:** `true`

    When set to `true`, a self-signed <Term document="docs/user/en/operate/tls.md">certificate authority</Term> 
    <Term document="docs/user/en/operate/tls.md">certificate</Term> and its 
    <Term document="docs/user/en/operate/tls.md">private key</Term> are automatically generated on server startup 
    and used to communicate with clients.
  </dd>
  <dt>folderPath</dt>
  <dd>
    **Default:** the sub-folder `evita-server-certificates` in the working directory

    It represents a path to a folder where the generated authority certificate and its private key are stored.
    This setting is used only when `generateAndUseSelfSigned` is set to `true`.
  </dd>
  <dt>custom</dt>
  <dd>
    This section allows you to configure an externally supplied <Term document="docs/user/en/operate/tls.md">certificate</Term>. 
    It is only used if the `generateAndUseSelfSigned` is set to `false`.

    The section requiers these nested settings: 

      - **`certificate`**: path to the public part of the certificate file (*.crt)
      - **`privateKey`**: path to the private key of the certificate (*.key)
      - **`privateKeyPassword`**: password for the private key

    <Note type="info">

    <NoteTitle toggles="false">
        
    ##### Tip
    </NoteTitle>

      It is recommended to provide the private key password using command line argument (environment variable) 
      `api.certificate.custom.privateKeyPasssword` and store id in a CI server secrets vault.
    </Note>

    <Note type="question">

    <NoteTitle toggles="true">
    
    ##### Is there an alternative to this manual configuration?
    </NoteTitle>

    Yes there is. You can use standardized way importing the 
    <Term document="docs/user/en/operate/tls.md">certificate authority</Term> 
    <Term document="docs/user/en/operate/tls.md">certificate</Term> to the Java trust store. This procedure is
    described in great detail in [this article](https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/how-to-import-public-certificates-into-javas-truststore-from-a-browser-a35e49a806dc).

    </Note>
  </dd>
</dl>

If no custom certificate is configured, the server will not start and an exception will be thrown. The server doesn't
provide an unsecured connection for security reasons.

### GraphQL API configuration

### REST API configuration

### gRPC API configuration

#### Mutual TLS configuration

### System API configuration

There is a special `api.endpoints.system` endpoint that allows access over the unsecured HTTP protocol. Since it's the
only exposed endpoint on the unsecured http protocol, it must run on a separate port. The endpoint allows anyone to
download the public part of the server certificate.

It also allows downloading the default client private/public key pair if `api.certificate.generateAndUseSelfSigned` and
`api.gRPC.mTLS` are both set to `true`. See [default unsecure mTLS behaviour](#default-mtls-behaviour--not-secure-) for
more information.
