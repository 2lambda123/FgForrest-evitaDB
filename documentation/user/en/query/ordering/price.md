  Ordering by selling price is one of the basic requirements for e-commerce applications. The price ordering constraint
  allows to sort the output entities by their selling price in ascending or descending order.

## Price natural

```evitaql-syntax
priceNatural(
    argument:enum(ASC|DESC)
)
```

<dl>
    <dt>argument:enum(ASC|DESC)</dt>
    <dd>
        the ordering direction (ascending or descending), **default value** is `ASC`
    </dd>
</dl>

This constraint allows output entities to be sorted by their [selling price](../filtering/price.md#price-for-sale-computation-algorithm) 
in their natural numeric order. It requires only the order direction and the price constraints in the `filterBy` section
of the query. The price variant (with or without tax) is determined by the [`priceType`](../requirements/price.md#price-type) 
requirement of the query (price with tax is used by default).

To sort products by their selling price (currently considering only `basic` price list and `CZK`), we can use 
the following query:
