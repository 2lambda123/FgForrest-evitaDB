title: Facet filtering
date: '29.10.2023'
perex: |
  Faceted filtering, also known as parameterized filtering, is a user interface feature that allows users to refine 
  search results by applying multiple filters based on various properties or "facets" like category, parameter, or 
  brand. Users can toggle these filters on or off to drill down into a data set interactively, essentially performing 
  real-time complex queries without technical knowledge. The benefits are twofold: First, it improves user experience 
  by enabling more targeted and efficient searching. Second, it can increase conversion rates for e-commerce sites by
  helping users quickly find and purchase products that meet their specific criteria.

**Work in progress**

This article will contain copy of:

- [facet summary](https://evitadb.io/research/assignment/querying/query_language#facet-summary)
- [facet conjunction](https://evitadb.io/research/assignment/querying/query_language#facet-groups-conjunction)
- [facet disjunction](https://evitadb.io/research/assignment/querying/query_language#facet-groups-disjunction)
- [facet negation](https://evitadb.io/research/assignment/querying/query_language#facet-groups-negated)

once it's proof-read.
