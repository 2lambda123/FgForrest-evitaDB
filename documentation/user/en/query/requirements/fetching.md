title: Fetching
perex: |
  Fetch request constraints help control the amount of data returned in the query response. This technique is used to 
  reduce the amount of data transferred over the network and to reduce the load on the server. Fetching is similar to 
  joins and column selection in SQL, but is inspired by data fetching in the GraphQL protocol by incrementally following
  the relationships in the data.

<LanguageSpecific to="evitaql,java,rest">

If no content requirement is used in the query, the result will contain only the primary key of the entity. While this 
may be sufficient for some queries, it is usually necessary to fetch some data from the entity or even other entities
related to the entity. For this purpose, the [`entityFetch`](#entity-fetch) request and nested *content* requests 
described in this section are used:

## Entity fetch

```evitaql-syntax
entityFetch(
    requireConstraint:(
        attributeContent|
        attributeContentAll|
        associatedDataContent|
        associatedDataContentAll|
        dataInLocales|
        dataInLocalesAll|
        hierarchyContent|       
        priceContent|
        priceContentAll|
        priceContentRespectingFilter|
        referenceContent|
        referenceContentWithAttributes|
        referenceContentAll|
        referenceContentAllWithAttributes
    )*   
)
```

<dl>
    <dt>requireConstraint:(...)*</dt>
    <dd>
        optional one or more constraints allowing you to instruct evitaDB to fetch the entity contents; 
        one or all of the constraints may be present:
        <ul>
            <li>[attributeContent](#attribute-content)</li>
            <li>[attributeContentAll](#attribute-content-all)</li>
            <li>[associatedDataContent](#associated-data-content)</li>
            <li>[associatedDataContentAll](#associated-data-content-all)</li>
            <li>[dataInLocales](#data-in-locales)</li>
            <li>[dataInLocalesAll](#data-in-locales-all)</li>
            <li>[hierarchyContent](#hierarchy-content)</li>
            <li>[priceContent/priceContentAll/priceContentRespectingFilter](#price-content)</li>
            <li>[referenceContent/referenceContentWithAttributes/referenceContentAll/referenceContentAllWithAttributes](#reference-content)</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>

The `entityFetch` (<SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/require/EntityFetch.java</SourceClass>)
requirement is used to trigger loading one or more entity data containers from the disk by its primary key. 
This operation requires a disk access unless the entity is already loaded in the database cache (frequently fetched
entities have higher chance to stay in the cache).

</LanguageSpecific>

<LanguageSpecific to="java">
In the Java API including the `entityFetch` requirement in the query changes the output type in the response container.
Instead of returning a <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/structure/EntityReference.java</SourceClass>
for each entity, the <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/SealedEntity.java</SourceClass>
type is returned.

## Entity content

The most simple data you can fetch in an entity is its primary key and type. These are returned from evitaDB with every query no matter how rich
you requested the entity to be.

<SourceCodeTabs langSpecificTabOnly>
[Getting code and name of the brand](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/examples/fetching/basic-entity-content.graphql)
</SourceCodeTabs>

Additionally, you can fetch other entity fields which triggers fetching entire entity body:

<dl>

    </dd>
</dl>

The `attributeContent` (<SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/require/AttributeContent.java</SourceClass>) 
requirement is used to retrieve one or more entity or reference [attributes](../../use/data-model.md#attributes-unique-filterable-sortable-localized). [Localized attributes](../../use/data-model.md#localized-attributes) 
are only fetched if there is a *locale context* in the query, either by using the [`entityLocaleEquals`](../filtering/locale.md#entity-locale-equals) 
filter constraint or the [`dataInLocales`](#data-in-locale) require constraint.

<Note type="info">

All entity attributes are fetched from disk in bulk, so specifying only a few of them in the `attributeContent`
requirement only reduces the amount of data transferred over the network. It's not bad to fetch all the attributes of 
an entity using [`attributeContentAll`](#attribute-content-all).

</Note>

To select a `code` and localized `name` attribute for the `Brand` entity, use the following query:

[Localized attributes](../../use/data-model.md#localized-attributes) need a *locale context* in the query,
either by using the [`entityLocaleEquals`](../filtering/locale.md#entity-locale-equals) filter constraint or
by explicitly specifying `locale` argument of the `attributes` field. Using GraphQL aliases, you can fetch the same
attributes in multiple locales in a single query.

</Note>

If the locale filter is missing in the query, but you still want to access the localized data, you can specify the `locale` argument

If the `locale` argument was not used in the query, accessing the *name* attribute would return an error.
In the example above, the *name* attribute is accessible in the Czech locale even though the `entityLocaleEquals` filter

To demonstrate the second scenario, let's say you want to filter a brand that has a Czech localization, but you want to
get Czech, German, and English *name* attribute values. The following query will do the job:

To select a *allActiveurls* and localized *localization* associated data for the `Brand` entity, use the following query:

The `dataInLocales` (<SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/require/DataInLocales.java</SourceClass>)
requirement is used in two scenarios:

1. there is no *locale context* in the filter part of the query, because you don't want to exclude entities without

   are available for the entity or reference
2. there is a *locale context* in the filter part of the query, but you want to fetch the localized data in different
   or additional languages than the one specified in the *locale context*

If the locale filter is missing in the query, but you still want to access the localized data, you can use the following

## Data in locales all

The `dataInLocalesAll` allows you to retrieve attributes and associated data in all available locales. This is usually 
useful in scenarios where you are publishing the data from the primary data source and you need to create/update all 
the data in one go. If you are accessing the data as a client application, you will probably always want to fetch 
the data in a specific locale, which means you will use the `dataInLocales` requirement with a single locale 
or `entityLocaleEquals` filtering constraint instead.
