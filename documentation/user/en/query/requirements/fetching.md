title: Fetching
perex: |
  Fetch request constraints help control the amount of data returned in the query response. This technique is used to 
  reduce the amount of data transferred over the network and to reduce the load on the server. Fetching is similar to 
  joins and column selection in SQL, but is inspired by data fetching in the GraphQL protocol by incrementally following
  the relationships in the data.

<LanguageSpecific to="evitaql,java,rest">

If no content requirement is used in the query, the result will contain only the primary key of the entity. While this 
may be sufficient for some queries, it is usually necessary to fetch some data from the entity or even other entities
related to the entity. For this purpose, the [`entityFetch`](#entity-fetch) request and nested *content* requests 
described in this section are used:

## Entity fetch

```evitaql-syntax
entityFetch(
    requireConstraint:(
        attributeContent|
        attributeContentAll|
        associatedDataContent|
        associatedDataContentAll|
        dataInLocales|
        dataInLocalesAll|
        hierarchyContent|       
        priceContent|
        priceContentAll|

        referenceContent|
        referenceContentWithAttributes|
        referenceContentAll|
        referenceContentAllWithAttributes
    )*   
)
```

<dl>
    <dt>requireConstraint:(...)*</dt>
    <dd>
        optional one or more constraints allowing you to instruct evitaDB to fetch the entity contents; 
        one or all of the constraints may be present:
        <ul>
            <li>[attributeContent](#attribute-content)</li>
            <li>[attributeContentAll](#attribute-content-all)</li>

    </dd>
</dl>

The `entityFetch` (<SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/require/EntityFetch.java</SourceClass>)
requirement is used to trigger loading one or more entity data containers from the disk by its primary key. 
This operation requires a disk access unless the entity is already loaded in the database cache (frequently fetched
entities have higher chance to stay in the cache).

</LanguageSpecific>

<LanguageSpecific to="java">
In the Java API including the `entityFetch` requirement in the query changes the output type in the response container.
Instead of returning a <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/structure/EntityReference.java</SourceClass>
for each entity, the <SourceClass>evita_api/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/requestResponse/data/SealedEntity.java</SourceClass>

## Entity content

The simplest data you can fetch with an entity is its primary key and type. These are returned by evitaDB with every query,
no matter how rich you requested the entity to be.

The `attributeContent` (<SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/require/AttributeContent.java</SourceClass>)

either by using the [`entityLocaleEquals`](../filtering/locale.md#entity-locale-equals) filter constraint or
by explicitly specifying `locale` argument of the `attributes` field. Using GraphQL aliases, you can fetch the same

The `dataInLocales` (<SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/require/DataInLocales.java</SourceClass>)
requirement is used in two scenarios:

1. there is no *locale context* in the filter part of the query, because you don't want to exclude entities without

2. there is a *locale context* in the filter part of the query, but you want to fetch the localized data in different

If the locale filter is missing in the query, but you still want to access the localized data, you can use the following

## Data in locales all

```evitaql-syntax

The `dataInLocalesAll` allows you to retrieve attributes and associated data in all available locales. This is usually 
useful in scenarios where you are publishing the data from the primary data source and you need to create/update all 
the data in one go. If you are accessing the data as a client application, you will probably always want to fetch 
the data in a specific locale, which means you will use the `dataInLocales` requirement with a single locale 
or `entityLocaleEquals` filtering constraint instead.

## Hierarchy content

<LanguageSpecific to="evitaql,java,rest">

```evitaql-syntax
hierarchyContent(
    requireConstraint:(entityFetch|stopAt)*
)
```

<dl>
    <dt>requireConstraint:(entityFetch|stopAt)*</dt>
    <dd>
        optional one or more constraints that allow you to define the completeness of the hierarchy entities and 
        the scope of the traversed hierarchy tree; 
        any or both of the constraints may be present:
        <ul>
            <li>[entityFetch](fetching.md#entity-fetch)</li>
            <li>[stopAt](hierarchy.md#stop-at)</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>

The `hierarchyContent` (<SourceClass>evita_query/src/main/java/io/evitadb/api/query/require/HierarchyContent.java</SourceClass>)
requirement allows you to access the information about the hierarchical placement of the entity.

If no additional constraints are specified, entity will contain a full chain of parent primary keys up to the root of 
a hierarchy tree. You can limit the size of the chain by using a `stopAt` constraint - for example, if you're only 
interested in a direct parent of each entity returned, you can use a `stopAt(distance(1))` constraint. The result is 
similar to using a [`parents`](hierarchy.md#parents) constraint, but is limited in that it doesn't provide information 
about statistics and the ability to list siblings of the entity parents. On the other hand, it's easier to use - since 
the hierarchy placement is directly available in the retrieved entity object.

If you provide a nested [`entityFetch`](#entity-fetch) constraint, the hierarchy information will contain the bodies of 
the parent entities in the required width. The [`attributeContent`](#attribute-content) inside the `entityFetch` allows 
you to access the attributes of the parent entities, etc.

To fetch an entity with basic hierarchy information, use the following query:

<SourceCodeTabs requires="evita_functional_tests/src/test/resources/META-INF/documentation/evitaql-init.java" langSpecificTabOnly>
[Getting localized name of the brand](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/examples/fetching/hierarchyContent.evitaql)
</SourceCodeTabs>

<Note type="info">

<NoteTitle toggles="true">

##### The result of an entity fetched with its hierarchy placement
</NoteTitle>

The query returns the following hierarchy of the `Category` entity:

<LanguageSpecific to="evitaql,java">

<MDInclude sourceVariable="recordPage">[The result of an entity fetch with hierarchy placement](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/examples/fetching/hierarchyContent.evitaql.json.md)</MDInclude>

</LanguageSpecific>
<LanguageSpecific to="rest">

<MDInclude sourceVariable="recordPage">[The result of an entity fetch with hierarchy placement](/documentation/user/en/query/requirements/examples/fetching/hierarchyContent.rest.json.md)</MDInclude>

</LanguageSpecific>

The `Category` entity is returned with the hierarchy information up to the root of the hierarchy tree.

</Note>

To demonstrate a more complex and useful example let's fetch a product with its category reference and for the category
fetch its full hierarchy placement up to the root of the hierarchy tree with `code` and `name` attributes of these
categories. The query looks like this:

The query returns the following product with the reference to the full `Category` entity hierarchy chain:

This quite complex example uses the [`referenceContent`](#reference-content) requirement that is described in a following
chapter.

To access the information about the hierarchical placement of an entity, use either the `parentPrimaryKey` or the `parents` field (or both).

The `parentPrimaryKey` field returns only the primary key of the direct parent of the entity. If the entity has no parent 
(i.e. it's a root entity), the field returns `null`.

The `parents` fields allows you to access the entire chain of parent entities up to the root of a hierarchy tree. Inside
you can use standard entity fields besides the `parents` field for the fetched parent entities. If no additional arguments
are specified the list will contain a entire chain of parent entities up to the root of a hierarchy tree. You can limit the
size of the chain by using a `stopAt` argument - for example, if you're only interested in a direct parent of each entity
returned, you can use a `stopAt: { distance: 1 }` argument. The arguments takes special require constraints to specify
on which node to stop the hierarchy traversal.
The result is similar to using a [`parents`](hierarchy.md#parents) requirement, but is limited in that it doesn't provide
information about statistics and the ability to list siblings of the entity parents. On the other hand, it's easier to 
use - since the hierarchy placement is directly available in the retrieved entity object.
